Hey there, üëã I'm Asma, and for me it's  all about creating awesome stuff as a Django REST API and C# Developer. Cool right ?

I'm a master when it comes to building robust Django REST APIs and crafting slick applications using C#. Just kidding I am not a master but you won't be disapointed, there are no master in dev world, just experienced folks.
